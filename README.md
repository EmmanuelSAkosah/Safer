## Safer
A disaster alert mobile app

### Overview

Safer is the flagship product of FloodPredict, a group of students and professionals aiming to combine their expertise to
create an accurate flood prediction tool to warn Accra Metroplitan Area (AMA) residents of fatal floods. Safer is a mobile app that gives users their realtime flood risk
status in the Accra Metroplitan Area. Along with many other features, Safer shows one of 'safe', 'risky' and 'dangerous' with each inidicating to users
how likely it is to flood in the next week. The goal is to warn AMA residents about impending floods so they can take
steps to prevent the loss of property and lives.
